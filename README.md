# ðŸ—¿ Monolith

Monolith is a kinetic sculpture that explores the universal human experience of containing multitudes through the lens of Disassociative Identity Disorder (DID). This piece communicates the fragmented existence of living with DID by visually representing the experience of 'switching', which is where one's conscious experience is not universally shared by a single self but rather experienced in fragments by distinct parts of the self. The piece uses linear actuators to press masks with a variety of facial expressions against latex panels while backlighting them, creating a relief of the face that constantly changes and is further distorted by lights on the rest of the sculpture turning on and off. A distorted recording of the artist's voice describing the experience of DID provides a jarring and rhythmic backround to the movement. The sculpture's design and overall aesthetic is intended to feel alien and disconcerting, which reflects the unease that is often present while switching between parts in day-to-day life.
